# VIGIL | Master Project Context (v 0.0.1.4)

## CANONICAL PHILOSOPHY & SYSTEM DEFINITION

**VIGIL: A Single-Surface System (Not a Website)**

---

### 1. Executive Identity
VIGIL is a "Layer 0.5" Security Standard. It operates strictly between human perception (UI/DOM) and cryptographic execution (Wallet signing). It is not a traditional website; it is a continuous operational surface where perception, motion, and decision-making are intentionally shaped.

### 2. Core Mandate
Restore human awareness. Most Web3 losses are caused by context loss and visual deception, not protocol hacks. VIGIL's mission is to secure the "Retinal Layer" before irreversible signatures occur.

### 3. Privacy Absolute
The system is non-custodial and local-first. Interaction history and trust graphs must stay in the browser's IndexedDB and never touch a remote server. Privacy is a security feature.

### 4. Aesthetic Identity: "Sovereign Tactical"
- **Palette**: High-contrast Zinc (#050505) backgrounds, Monolithic Void.
- **Accents**: Refractive glows in Emerald (Safe), Cyan (Intel), and Pulsing Red (Threat).
- **Typography**: Monolithic italic typography, JetBrains Mono for telemetry, Inter for narrative.
- **Design Rule**: Elements should feel like physical tactical hardware (pagers, terminals) rather than software menus.

### 5. Architectural Layers
- **Layer 0**: Intent Origination (The dApp UI/DOM).
- **Layer 0.5**: VIGIL Interception (The validation vector).
- **Layer 1**: Execution Settlement (The Wallet/Signature).

### 6. Development Governance
- **Performance First**: Sub-12ms operational latency is mandatory.
- **Narrative Integrity**: Do not deviate from the "Sovereign Tactical" voice.
- **Local-First**: No external tracking, no telemetry leaks, no cloud-side sensitive data.

### 7. Logic Registry (Shared Intelligence)
To maintain **Neural Parity** across platforms, the following modules are designated as **Shared Mathematical Primitives**. They power both the Website Simulations (Operator Training) and the Field Unit (Background Monitoring).

- **Authoring Layer**: All logic is authored in TypeScript (.ts/.tsx) within the Neural Hub.
- **Execution Layer**: The Field Unit utilizes standard ES6 JavaScript (.js) for browser runtime compliance.
- **Heuristic Engine (`/services/geminiService.ts`):** High-level cognitive layer for autopsy and reputation synthesis.
- **Validation Primitive (`/utils/addressValidator.ts`):** Low-level cryptographic string validation (Base58/Solana).
- **Collision Engine (`/utils/addressDiff.ts`):** Mathematical comparison layer for detecting character poisoning and entropy deviation.
- **Threat Vocabulary (`/types.ts`):** Shared type definitions and security event classifications.

**Neural Parity Protocol:** Any update to these modules must be verified in both simulation (Website) and field (Extension) environments to prevent safety discrepancies.

### 8. The Neural Parity Protocol (NPP)
The NPP is the systemic anchor of VIGIL. It ensures that the security outcomes of the **Command Center** and the **Field Unit** are mathematically identical.

- **Zero Divergence Rule**: A "Neural Event" (logic change) is only successful if simulation outcomes exactly match field outcomes for identical inputs.
- **Transpilation Integrity**: The conversion from TypeScript source to JavaScript execution must be bit-perfect in logic to ensure that the Field Unit never deviates from the Command Center's intelligence.
- **Authorial Unity**: Logic must never be rewritten for a specific platform. It is authored in the Neural Hub and mirrored to the target via the Shadow Sync protocol.
- **Verdict Integrity**: If the training simulation classifies an address as a threat, the Extension must reach the same verdict in the field using bit-perfect logic.

### 9. Communication Transparency Protocol (CTP)
To ensure absolute clarity during the development of the VIGIL ecosystem, every technical modification must be accompanied by a **Registry Update Report (RUR)** provided in the terminal interface.

- **Mandatory Fields**:
    - **Vector of Change**: Specifies the exact module, component, or file targeted for modification.
    - **Logical Deltas**: A high-level explanation of what logic was added, removed, or altered.
    - **Verification Path**: The directory path(s) where the operator can inspect the changes.
    - **Handshake Confirmation**: Concrete instructions on how to observe or test the update.
